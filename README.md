Financial Data Analysis Project

The current macro climate is far from steady with inflation,war,job layoffs and financial market volatility. 

We wish to drown out this wider noise and see how much rapid growth bubbles may actually be a more technical reason for markets dropping this year
and if investors can get greater insights into their decision making through machine learning and modelling.

We are looking to use Python for price data collection and forecasting- looking at different asset class pairs to see their degree of cointegration.

Assets chosen for preliminary analysis include:
* Gold          *Twitter      *Euro/USD
*Crude Oil/USD  *BTC/USD      *NASDAQ
*TSLA           *SnP500
*GM             *Phizer

Python also offers good scope for Data Visualisation and plotting we we wish to explore in our EDA

We look to use a mixture of price data and technical indicators such as EMA's Volume etc as inpits to our Modelling

The models will be cross validated and optimised.

If there is time we will seek to expand the scope to include deep Neural networks in our analysis. 

We then wish to use the above insights to develope a basic trading strategy,signal indicator prototype that can be used for more optimal decision making.
